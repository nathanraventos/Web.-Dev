<h2>Nathan Raventos</h2>
<h2>You can call me Nate!</h2>
<p>Like I said my name is Nate and I am from Saratoga Springs, Utah.<p></p>
 This is actually my first semester at BYU Idaho and I am excited to be here. <p></p> 
    Right now my major is Computer Science,but I'm not absolutely sure yet. I just returned from an LDS mission to California and Japan and I
     actually decided to study CS while I was out. on my mission.<p></p>
        Some of my hobbies are playing sports, hiking, camping, and reading. If you ever want to play a game of Spikeball or Pickleball let me know.<p></p> I'm usually playing with 
        my siblings and friends who are at BYUI with me, and so it's always fun. I am really excited to be here in Idaho because I'm not a huge fan of big cities, and so this 
        place is perfect for me. <p></p>I hope we get to know each other a little better in the coming weeks! Thanks!
