                <h1>Protein</h1>
                <p>Protein is essential for muscle gain as it provides amino acids crucial for repairing and building muscle tissue after exercise. Maintaining a positive nitrogen balance through adequate protein intake supports lean muscle mass development. Protein also helps regulate appetite, aiding in weight management, and is a cornerstone for effective muscle growth, from animal or plant-based sources.</p>

                <h1>Calories</h1>
                <p>Calories are a fundamental factor in the muscle gain process, serving as the energy source for various physiological functions, including muscle protein synthesis. Consuming a surplus of calories, where intake exceeds expenditure, creates an environment conducive to muscle growth. It provides the necessary energy for intense workouts and supports the anabolic processes that lead to muscle hypertrophy. </p>

                <h2>Supplements</h1>
                <p>Supplements, like creatine, play a vital role in muscle gain by enhancing ATP production for more effective workouts. Additionally, protein powders and BCAAs provide convenient ways to support muscle repair and recovery. While beneficial, it's important to integrate supplements wisely and consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance in achieving optimal muscle-building results.</p>
