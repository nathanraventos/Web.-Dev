      <h3>Workout techniques</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest parts of getting bigger is the exercises you do. Through this website you will be able to see many basic exercises and how to perform them. Sometimes you hit the gym knowing what you want to work, but you just don’t know how to do things that help you improve. That is why on this website we have pictures of each workout you might want to try out. 

        We will be providing a quick explanation of how to properly do the workout, as well as the benefits of each workout that are on this site, and what muscle groups they work out. It also has sections for each of those muscle groups, so you can get a clear and precise workout plan for each of your gym days. Want chest workout? Here are all of the basic chest workouts! Not only that though, but you will have the associated triceps workout that usually comes along with doing chest exercises.

      </ul>
      <h3>Diet</h3>
      <p>
        One of the other biggest parts about getting fitter and gaining muscle is your eating habits. In this sight, you will have the opportunity to see what kind of foods will be good for you as you work out. Not only that, but you will be able to see how much of each food group you should be eating. A large mistake beginners make when going to the gym is not eating the right foods out of the gym, even when you are not working out. This site will fix that problem by allowing you to easily see what kind of foods, and how much food you should be eating with the amount of exercise you are doing at the gym. 
        By learning about your eating habits, you will be able to stay focused on your gym goals throughout the week, even when you are busy doing other things. You will have more motivation to stay true to your goals because of the efforts you are putting into this goal as the days, weeks, and months progress. You will become the beast you have been wanting to become.
